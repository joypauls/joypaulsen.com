# Work

## Current

My team at Target builds automated systems to classify products into semantically meaningful themes. Previously, I worked on a cross-functional team developing performant streaming applications for real-time inference that was used to enhance web and mobile UX. Additionally, I have worked on both traditional and deep learning-based recommendation systems integrated into several different products during my time at Target.

## Previously

Before that, I was a member of the wonderful data science team at C.H. Robinson, a third-party logistics (3PL) provider. I ended my time there leading a team focused on building fast recommentation systems and search engine capabilities for their flagship app, having previously worked on a diverse range of problem spaces including pricing and demand forecasting.
