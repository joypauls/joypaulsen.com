# Work

## Current

My cross-functional team at Target primarily focuses on building performant streaming applications for real-time inference used to enhance UX on the flagship website and mobile app. Additionally, I have also worked on both traditional and deep learning recommendation systems in various contexts during my time at Target.

## Previously

Before that, I was a member of the wonderful data science team at C.H. Robinson, a third-party logistics (3PL) provider. I ended my time there leading a team focused on building fast recommentation systems and search engine capabilities for their flagship app, having previously worked on a diverse range of problem spaces including pricing and demand forecasting.
